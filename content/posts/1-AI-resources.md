This month, I enrolled into a 10-month course in Artificial Intelligence. In this blog, I will be documenting my journey. 

What we have already covered in the first two weeks (yes, they throw things at us rapidly and furiously):

- Overview of ML
- some practice in Numpy, Jupyter notebooks 
- touched on scikit, matplotlib, seaborn 
- SimBrain: data preparation for a movie rating dataset
- Tableau: installation and getting familiar

## Suggested books:

- Python for Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit & TensorFlow

## Youtube resources

I could not understand right away just what I was supposed to do with the data preparation for the movie ratings dataset. How would I choose the input training data, how would I decide which ones were important, and how would I assign weights to them? I understood that I was lacking the big underlying picture of what I was doing.... That sent me searching. 

The instructor made us to clean and split data in Excel... This is how I stumbled on a video of simulating a neural network in Excel. Can you believe that only Excel does the full process of machine learning here!

However, where the formulas used in the above videos came from? The author of the video said that he was guided by this book:

[Book: Make Your Own Neural Network](https://www.amazon.ca/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network/dp/1530826608/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NXDRWJW30KXR&keywords=make+your+own+neural+network&qid=1558320798&s=gateway&sprefix=make+your+own+%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-1)

This instructor is amazing!!

This channel is a treasure trove of Data Science info:
